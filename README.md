# 🚗 Drowsy Driver Detection System using OpenCV and CNN 😴

A real-time drowsiness detection system that alerts drivers when signs of fatigue are detected using computer vision and deep learning. This project leverages **OpenCV** for video capture and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for eye state classification.

## 🧠 Overview

Drowsy driving is a major cause of road accidents. This system monitors the driver’s eyes using a webcam and alerts them if their eyes remain closed for a certain period, indicating drowsiness.

- **Real-time detection** using webcam
- **Eye state classification**: Open vs Closed
- Alerts user via **sound alarm**
- Built using Python, OpenCV, and Keras/TensorFlow
